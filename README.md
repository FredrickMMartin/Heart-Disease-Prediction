# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## General Project Goals (in order of priority)
1. To practise skills related to data exploration and classification
2. To answer questions that I had about the process of building a pipeline and creating a classifer
3. To build a classifier that significantly outperforms a baseline in predicting the presence of heart disease based from patient medical data.

## Context
This was a project that I began working on with a mentor as an opportunity to put into practise skills that I had picked up from various courses that I have completed/ books that I have read. Unfortunately, my collaboration with that mentor ended before this project was completed and so I never had a chance for feedback on the final output.

## Files
### heart.csv
This is the data that I was working on. The details of the data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).

### extended_heart_disease.pkl
This is the pickled version of the data frame that I create in the Write_up_EOD notebook. This is output at the end of that notebook.

### useful_lists.pkl
This is the pickled version of a dictionary of lists that I wanted to be able to use after creating in Write_up_EOD.

### Write_up_EOD.ipynb
This is the first of 2 notebooks that contain the work of this project.
This file explores the initial data set and engineers some basic additional features before exporting the new version of the data.

### Write_up_Classifying.ipynb
In this 2nd notebook, I test different approaches to classifying the data.
This includes examining different algorithms, using different feature subsets and some minimal hyper-parameter optimising.

## Questions/Commnents/Feedback
As someone who is very keen to develop my knowledge/skills in this area I would welcome openly any feedback that you have. I am also happy to answer any questions if there are any. If you have any questions then hit me up! I'll answer as best I can.
